# Coupon-Acceptance
Machine Learning Model to predict if the customers will accept the Coupon on an E-Commerce website

Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will accept a coupon based on factors like demographics, time, and behavior.

Problem Statement: 
Businesses use coupons to attract customers, but not everyone redeems them. Understanding which customers are likely to accept a coupon can help businesses target the right audience, improving marketing efficiency.

Outcome:
We explored the dataset, cleaned and prepared the data, and tested different machine learning models. After evaluation, we identified the best model for predicting coupon acceptance. This can help businesses make better marketing decisions and increase customer engagement.
